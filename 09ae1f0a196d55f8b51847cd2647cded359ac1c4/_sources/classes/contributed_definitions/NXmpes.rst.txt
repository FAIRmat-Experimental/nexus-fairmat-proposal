          In the case of a monchromatic beam this is the scalar energy. Several other use cases are permitted, depending on the presence of other incident_energy_X fields. In the case of a polychromatic beam this is an array of length m of energies, with the relative weights in incident_energy_weights. In the case of a monochromatic beam that varies shot-to-shot, this is an array of energies, one for each recorded shot. Here, incident_energy_weights and incident_energy_spread are not set. In the case of a polychromatic beam that varies shot-to-shot, this is an array of length m with the relative weights in incident_energy_weights as a 2D array. In the case of a polychromatic beam that varies shot-to-shot and where the channels also vary, this is a 2D array of dimensions nP by m (slow to fast) with the relative weights in incident_energy_weights as a 2D array. Note, variants are a good way to represent several of these use cases in a single dataset, e.g. if a calibrated, single-value energy value is available along with the original spectrum from which it was calibrated.
