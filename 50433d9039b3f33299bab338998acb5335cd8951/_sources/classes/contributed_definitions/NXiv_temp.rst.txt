**Status**:

  application definition, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  Application definition for temperature-dependent IV curve measurements.

  In this application definition, times should be specified always together
  with an UTC offset.

  This is the application definition describing temperature dependent IV curve
  measurements. For this a temperature is set. After reaching the temperature,
  a voltage sweep is performed. For each voltage a current is measured.
  Then, the next desired temperature is set and an IV measurement is performed.
  The application definition defines:
  - elements of the experimental instrument
  - calibration information if available
  - parameters used to tune the state of the sample
  - sample description

**Symbols**:

  Variables used throughout the document, e.g. dimensions and important
  parameters

  **N_data_points**: Number of elements in the scanned voltage array

  **N_variables**: Number of additional variables that are changed with the temperature (can be understood as columns next to the temperature)

  **N_different_temperatures**: Number of different temperatures that are set
